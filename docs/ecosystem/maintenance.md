# Long-Term Maintenance

This repository will be archived after release `v0.1.0`. All future maintenance will continue in the ASCS e.V. repository.

## What Changes

- This repository becomes read-only after the release cut
- The authoritative source moves to `ASCS-eV/ontology-management-base`
- Issues and pull requests should be opened in the ASCS repository

## Why It Matters

The long-term governance of ENVITED-X ontologies is managed by ASCS e.V. to ensure continuity beyond the Gaia-X 4 PLC-AAD project phase.
