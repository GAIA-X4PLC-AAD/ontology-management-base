# ENVITED-X Data Space

ENVITED-X is the semantic backbone for simulation assets in the Automotive Solution Center for Simulation e.V. (ASCS).

## Long-Term Usage

The ontologies in this repository enable interoperable simulation assets across the ENVITED ecosystem. They cover domains such as scenarios, HD maps, sensor models, and manifest metadata, and they integrate Gaia-X semantics for trust and governance.

## Data Space Alignment

ENVITED-X ontologies provide the data contracts used in the ENVITED-X data space. They ensure assets are discoverable, validated, and exchangeable across organizations.
