# Ontology Management Base

This repository is the working home for the ENVITED-X and Gaia-X4PLC-AAD ontology stack. It contains the OWL ontologies, SHACL shapes, JSON-LD contexts, validation tools, and publishing utilities used across the ecosystem.

## Important Notice

After release `v0.0.5`, this repository will be archived as read-only. Ongoing maintenance will continue at `ASCS-eV/ontology-management-base`. Plan new contributions against that repository after the release cut.

## What You Can Do Here

- Install, test, build, and contribute to the ontology toolchain
- Use the ontologies with stable W3ID IRIs and local artifacts
- Search and discover domains via `docs/registry.json`
- Validate data and schemas with the catalog-based tooling
- Understand the Gaia-X connection and Gaia-X4PLC-AAD publishing workflow
- Follow the long-term ENVITED ecosystem strategy and future LinkML migration
