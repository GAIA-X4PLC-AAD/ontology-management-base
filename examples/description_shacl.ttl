### Before using this SHACL template make sure to have a look into the Ontology template and make sure to understand the core concepts of Ontologies, SHACLs and RDF

### Just like in the Ontology we can find a Prefix Section within the SHACL Shape aswell
@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix example: <http://example.org/example/> . # This is the prefix we defined through the @base tag in the ontology
@prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#> .

### The following lines provide the actual content of the SHACL Shape, i. e. the constraints we want to set for a specific object
example:ExampleServiceOfferingShape # This is the subject our predicates & objects will refer to
	a sh:NodeShape ; # This line specifies that our Subject (example:ExampleServiceOfferingShape) is from the type SHACL Shape
	sh:targetClass example:ExampleServiceOffering ; # This line specifies the class our Nodeshape(=SHACL Shape) is applied to. This class has been defined within the ontology. 
	# Now we define the properties of our class
	sh:property # This is the predicate of our triple, the subject is still "example:ExampleServiceOfferingShape"
	# The following lines denote the object of our triple, which is a list of key/value-pairs
	[
		sh:path example:property1 ; # This is the specification of our property usually provided as an IRI pointing to an Ontology where the property is further specified
		sh:datatype xsd:string ;  # This is the datatype of our property, usually we use xml datatypes (http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#), but other datatypes conforming to the RDF literal abstraction could also be used. 
		skos:example "Property 1 Value" ; # An example value how this property could be filled
		sh:minCount 1 ;  # Indicates that this is a mandatory property. Each instance of the tagetClass needs to have at least 1 of this property. We could also specify a maxCount.
		sh:message "Validation of property1 failed" ; # Error Message if this property is not provided in a proper way
		sh:name "Property 1" ; # An alternative name for the property
		sh:description "A description that describes property 1."@en ; # A description for the property
	] ; # The next property still refers to "example:ExampleServiceOfferingShape" as the subject
	sh:property # Now we have similar key/value-pairs as in the property before.
	[
		sh:path example:property2 ;
		sh:datatype xsd:string ; 
		skos:example "Property 2 Value" ;
		sh:minCount 1 ;
		sh:message "Validation of property2 failed" ;
		sh:name "Property 2" ;
		sh:description "A description that describes property 2."@en ;
	] ; 
	sh:property # This property is special in a way that it provides the possibility to link to another class. Whenever you use a property linking between classes, you need to specify the domain & range of the regarding property in an ontology (have a look into the description_ontology-file for more information).
	[
		sh:path example:belongs_to ; 
		sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ; # This attribute is set instead of "sh:datatype". It denotes that this property needs to have a node, which is expressed in form of an IRI. This enables linkage between different classes.
		sh:minCount 1 ;
		sh:message "Validation of Identifier of related Self Description failed" ;
		sh:name "Belongs to" ;
		sh:description "Identifier of related Self Description."@en ;
