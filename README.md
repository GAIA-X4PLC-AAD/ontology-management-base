# Ontology Management

## Purpose

This repository is used to maintain the custom Ontologies and associated SHACL Shapes that are used within a specific Scope. It's also used to ensure a unified process for handling the Ontologies & Shapes.

**Ontologies** are required, when there is a need to introduce a custom type for a Self Description which should be expressed
as an OWL class. For each class a **SHACL Shape** _must_ be defined, which defines the properties for the class and optional
constraints.

## Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GAIA-X4PLC-AAD/ontology-management-base.git
cd ontology-management-base
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements_ci.txt
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install & Configure `pre-commit`

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Verify installation:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run Tests Locally

```bash
python3 src/run_all_checks_locally.py
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Commit with `Signed-off-by` (Required for DCO Compliance)

To automatically add a sign-off when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -S -m "Your commit message"
```

#### Configure signing

You can add a commit hook to ensure that all commits include a Signed-off-by line. The process for setting up this hook is described in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file. This helps maintain compliance with the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) requirements.
Adding a GPG Key for Commit Signing to sign your commits with a GPG key, follow the instructions provided in the [GitHub GPG documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

By following these steps, you can ensure that your commits are signed with your GPG key, adding an extra layer of security and verification to your contributions.

## Repository structure

The repository contains a folder for each domain in the project which stores Turtle files for the domain-specific Ontologies and
associated SHACL Shapes.

Example files can be found in the folder [example](https://github.com/GAIA-X4PLC-AAD/ontology-management-base/tree/main/example) in the this repository.

## Process

This section describes the general process to apply changes to the Ontologies & SHACL Shapes.

### General process

1. Checkout the repository
2. Create a local feature branch that will store the changes
3. Perform changes (see [Modeling Guidelines](#modeling-guidelines), [Creating a new Ontology & Shape](#creating-a-new-ontology--shape) or [Modify an existing Ontology & Shape](#modify-an-existing-ontology--shape))
4. Run tests locally
5. Push the branch to remote
6. Check the [CI pipeline](#ci-pipeline) status.
7. Open a _Pull Request_ and describe the changes according to the provided template which should help the Reviewer to
   understand why the changes are important from you point of view
8. [Review process](#review-process-responsibilities) performed by Reviewers
9. (optional) Apply changes recommended by the Reviewer
10. Reviewer merges _Pull Request_ to `main` branch and adds the changes (SHACL file and/or Ontology file) to the Federated Catalogue via its API (supported by Github Action)

### üõ† Ontology Validation Testing

Each ontology in this repository includes a dedicated `tests/` folder to ensure compliance with its SHACL validation rules. These tests help maintain data integrity by checking that instances conform to the defined ontology constraints.

### **Test Structure**

Each ontology (e.g., `manifest/`, `general/`, `hdmap/`) may contain a `tests/` directory with failing test cases designed to validate SHACL constraints. Example structure:

```bash
/manifest/tests/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fail_missing_license_instance.json        # Missing required license
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fail_missing_license_instance.expected      # No manifest shape defined
```

For each test case, there is a corresponding `.expected` file that defines the expected validation error message from `PySHACL`:

```bash
/manifest/tests/fail_missing_license_instance.expected
```

Example content:

```bash
Validation Report
Conforms: False
Results (1):
Constraint Violation in MinCountConstraintComponent (http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#MinCountConstraintComponent):
        Severity: sh:Violation
        Source Shape: [ sh:description Literal("Defines the license(s) valid for all content referenced in the manifest. Does not apply to linked data(sets) with explicit license terms.", lang=en) ; sh:minCount Literal("1", datatype=xsd:integer) ; sh:node manifest:LicenseShape ; sh:order Literal("1", datatype=xsd:integer) ; sh:path manifest:license ]
        Focus Node: <did:web:registry.gaia-x.eu:Manifest:fail_missing_license_instance>
        Result Path: manifest:license
        Message: Less than 1 values on <did:web:registry.gaia-x.eu:Manifest:fail_missing_license_instance>->manifest:license

```

### **Running Tests Locally**

To validate test cases locally, run:

```bash
python3 src/run_all_checks_locally.py
```

This script:

- Dynamically detects ontology directories by scanning the repository, excluding non-ontology folders (src/, .git/, .github/, .venv/, etc.).
- Checks Turtle (.ttl) syntax for all ontology files, ensuring valid RDF syntax.
- Validates JSON-LD files against SHACL schemas, checking if instances conform to their SHACL constraints.
- Runs failing test cases from each ontology‚Äôs tests/ folder and verifies that expected validation errors occur.
- Ensures validation correctness by comparing actual SHACL validation output with expected failure messages.
- Fails the script immediately if any validation error occurs, preventing unnoticed ontology issues.
- Logs detailed validation output for debugging, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

By maintaining a structured set of failing test cases, we ensure that the ontologies remain robust and enforce the intended constraints effectively. üöÄ

### Creating a new Ontology & Shape

In the case you want to create a new Class which is not suitable for the existing Ontologies, you should create a new Ontology
that contains this class. An Ontology describes a set of classes in a specific subject area and how they are related. A domain may contain multiple Ontologies.

1. Create a folder for the Domain, if it does not already exist.
2. Create a Turtle file for the Ontology
3. Describe the new type as an OWL Class in the Ontology
4. Create a Turtle file for the SHACL Shape
5. Describe a `NodeShape` in the SHACL file that refers to the class created in step 3 and describes its properties and their
   constraints
6. Add a new entry to the CODEOWNERS file in the root directory of this repository and specify the owners for the new directory (see [Review process](#review-process-responsibilities) section below).

### Modify an existing Ontology & Shape

In the case you want to create a new Class which fits to any of the existing Ontologies in the Domain, you should add
this class to the existing Ontology.

1. Describe the new type as an OWL Class in the existing Ontology
2. Describe a `NodeShape` in the SHACL file that refers to the class created in step 1 and describes its properties and their
   constraints

### Review process responsibilities

- With github CODEOWNERS concept it is possible to define responsible users for certain directories.
- This is maintained in the CODEOWNERS file in the root directory of this repository.
- See CODEOWNERS file for github documentation and more information.
- Two reviewers should be defined. One for the syntactical part and one for the semantical part.
  - Syntactical check (reviewer 1)
    - Check whether modeling guidelines described in this README are followed.
    - Check the [CI pipeline](#ci-pipeline) status.
  - Semantical check (reviewer 2)
    - Check whether the recommended changes make sense (Is there a real need for these changes? Are there probably better solutions?).
- After the review is done, the reviewer assigns the PR back to the author for incorporation.
- After incorporation is done, the author assigns the PR back to the reviewer for final review (and so forth).

## Modeling Guidelines

This section describes guidelines that _must_ be followed when applying changes to this repository.

### General

- For _every_ custom class modeled in an Ontology a SHACL Shape must be created that is linked to the class. In addition to that there must be an example on an instance of a SHACL Shape.  
- Class and attributes names must be in English.

### Directories & files

- Each domain has its own directory in the root of the repository.
- Folders and filename are lowercase and words are separated by `-` (except the `_` as separator for the suffix, see below).
- The name of the directory must match the prefix defined in the Ontology and SHACL files.
- Ontologies are stored in Turtle files having a name in describing the purpose of the Ontology and a suffix `_ontology`.
  Example: `sensor_ontology.ttl`
- SHACL Shapes are stored in Turtle files having the suffix `_shacl`. Example:
  `sensor_shacl.ttl`
- The example instance of a SHACL Shape is stored in json-ld format in a json file with the suffix `_instance`. Example: `sensor_instance.json`. The content stored in the json file is also called _claims_.
  - The [SD-Creation-Wizard](https://sd-creation-wizard.gxfs.gx4fm.org/) can be used to generate the example instance of a SHACL Shape.

### Ontologies

- Class TYPE A may be a subclass of one of the Gaia-X base classes
- Class TYPE B may optionally be an `envited-x:SimulationAsset` subclass
- The name of the class must be in PascalCase. Example: `Sensor`
- The attributes of the class must be in camelCase. Example: `sensorType`
- The prefix of the ontology must point to this repository. Example for `sensor`:

  ```turtle
  @prefix sensor: <https://github.com/GAIA-X4PLC-AAD/ontology-management-base/tree/main/sensor/> .
- The prefix of the ontology must match the prefix defined in the SHACL Shape.

### SHACL Shapes

- The name of the shape must be in PascalCase. Example: `SensorShape`
- The attributes of the shape must be in camelCase. Example: `sensorType`
- Shapes have the name of the linked Ontology class and a suffix `Shape`. Example: `SensorShape`
- Shapes must be linked with the associated OWL Class via the property `sh:targetClass`
- References to other Self Descriptions are specified by a property having `sh:nodeKind sh:IRI`
- The prefix of the SHACL Shape must match the prefix defined in the ontology.
- If worth explaining, examples should be given. Specify concrete valid input here. Values should match with sh:In. Separate multiple entries with a comma. Example: '3DMS system, Trimble xyz, Riegl xyz'
- If explanations are required, meaningful descriptions should be added. Example: 'Size of the file to be downloaded in MB.'
- Every TYPE B class must be subclass of `envited-x:SimulationAsset` and implement subclasses of this superclass. See e.g. `hdmap:HdMap`as an example.
- Every TYPE A Shape linking to an ontology must **nest** the `general` Shape. Example:
  - Add prefix

    ```turtle
    @prefix general:https://github.com/GAIA-X4PLC-AAD/ontology-management-base/tree/main/general/ .
    @prefix general:https://github.com/GAIA-X4PLC-AAD/ontology-management-base/tree/main/hdmap/ .
    ```

  - Nest the `GeneralShape` as a node. Replace `<your_prefix>` with the prefix of the ontology

    ```turtle
    sh:property [ sh:maxCount 1 ;
                sh:minCount 1 ;
                sh:node general:GeneralShape ;
                # some other attributes like description, order, etc.
                sh:path <your_prefix>:general ],
    ```

## CI pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is defined in the `.github/workflows` directory. The pipeline is triggered on every push to the repository as defined in the workflow. The result can be seen in the `Actions` tab in the github repository.

### Steps

#### Generate PROPERTIES.md (overview of used properties in the SHACL files)

The file PROPERTIES.md will be generated automatically when a push to a non-main branch is executed. This file is existent in every subdirectory once there is a SHACL file containing properties. This should help to get a fast overview of the properties used in the SHACL files.

>NOTE: the PROPERTIES.md file should not be changed since it will be overwritten automatically.

#### Check syntax of Turtle files

The pipeline checks the syntax of the Turtle files (`*.ttl`) by loading a RDF graph. If the Turtle file is not correct the pipeline fails with a detailed error message.

#### Check if `_instance.json` file is conform to the SHACL Shape(s)

The pipeline checks if the `_instance.json` file is conform to the SHACL Shape(s) defined in the corresponding SHACL file. For this all `*_shacl.ttl` files in this repository are collected to be able to check against a schema not defined in the current SHACL Shape. If the instance is not conform the pipeline fails with a detailed error message.

#### Check if all target classes of a SHACL file are specified in the corresponding ontology file

The pipeline checks if all target classes of a SHACL file are specified in the corresponding ontology file. If a target class is not specified in the ontology file the pipeline fails with a detailed error message.

### Known issues

#### Issues with [SD-Creation-Wizard](https://sd-creation-wizard.gxfs.gx4fm.org/)

- The wizard does not support the creation of a SHACL Shape with a nested external Shape, e. g. `GeneralShape` in `SensorShape`. To do this you have to temporarily copy the `GeneralShape` into the `SensorShape` file. This applies to all external Shapes which are not defined in the file which is loaded into the wizard.
- The wizard may generate a non conform `_instance` file when having optional structures which have mandatory attributes.
  Example: `relatedData` in `GeneralShape`:

  ```turtle
        [ sh:node general:LinkShape ;
            sh:description "Reference to optional related assets" ;
            skos:example "at hd map, link to optional surface map" ;
            sh:name "relatedData" ;
            sh:order 2 ;
            sh:path general:relatedData ];
  ```

  If `relatedData` is not filled in the wizard, following block will be generated:

  ```json
      "general:relatedData": {
        "@type": "general:Link"
      }
  ```

  This is obviously not conform since the mandatory files `url` and `type` of `LinkShape` are missing. This [bug](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/xfsc/self-description-tooling/sd-creation-wizard-frontend/-/issues/41) will be fixed in the future.

- If there are nested "external" shapes, e.g. `Range2DShape`, you should check whether it has been correctly attached into the correct structure in the instance file and is not duplicated. If it is duplicated, you should remove the duplicated part. This [issue](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/xfsc/self-description-tooling/sd-creation-wizard-api/-/issues/25) leads to problems in the proof validation.

- SD-Wizard does not process Logical Constraint Components. For example, if I use sh:xone in the shacl, all combinations are possible in the SD wizard, although only one field needs to be entered explicitly.
I would expect that saving in export format is only enabled if the condition is met. See [issue](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/xfsc/self-description-tooling/sd-creation-wizard-api/-/issues/27).

> Feel free to contribute to the wizard to fix this or other issues in the gitlab repositories [backend](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/xfsc/self-description-tooling/sd-creation-wizard-api) or [frontend](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/xfsc/self-description-tooling/sd-creation-wizard-frontend).
